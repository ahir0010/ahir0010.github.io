                    <article class="p">SpaceX is a private spaceflight company that sends satellites and people to
                        space, including NASA crews
                        to the International Space Station (ISS). Founder Elon Musk is also creating and testing a
                        Starship
                        system for lunar landings and, he hopes, future crewed Mars missions. The company sent its first
                        two
                        astronauts to the ISS on May 30, 2020, aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon and has sent several more
                        crews
                        aloft on behalf of NASA and other entities.

                        As of mid-2022, it is the only commercial spaceflight company capable of sending astronauts to
                        space,
                        although it may soon face competition from Boeing's CST-100 Starliner. He spent a third of his
                        reported
                        fortune, $100 million, to get SpaceX going. There was skepticism that he would be successful,
                        which
                        persisted into SpaceX's first years.

                        After spending 18 months toiling privately on a spacecraft, SpaceX unveiled the craft in 2006
                        under the
                        name Dragon. Musk reportedly named the spacecraft after "Puff, the Magic Dragon," a 1960s song
                        from the
                        folk group Peter, Paul and Mary. He said he chose the name because critics believed his
                        spaceflight aims
                        were impossible. Musk was already an experienced businessman when he started SpaceX, and he
                        strongly
                        believed that more frequent and more reliable launches would bring down the cost of exploration.
                        So, he
                        sought out a stable customer that could fund the early development of a rocket: NASA. (Later, he
                        wooed
                        launch clients from various sectors to diversify his customer base.) As such, his goal for
                        SpaceX was to
                        develop the first privately built, liquid-fueled booster to make it into orbit, which he called
                        the
                        Falcon 1. </article>
