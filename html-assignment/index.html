        <p>
            Hey myself Hemil I'm from <strong>Surat, Gujarat, India</strong>.
            I was born on 18<sup>th</sup> October 2003.
            In India I completed my 12<sup>th</sup> grade.
            Right now my course is <em>Interactive media design</em> in 
            <strong>Algonquin College, Ottawa</strong>.
            While schooling I developed my interest in some sports
            like <abbr title="sports">Football, Cricket, Volleyball, Speedball</abbr>.
            I'm a national Speedball player by the way.
        </p>
            <p>
                Besides that I love <strong>Travelling</strong>.
                I never missed any <em>school</em> trip.
                The trip in which we had been at <abbr title="Place">Igatpuri</abbr>
                I enjoyed a lot. It was my last trip with my school friends.
                About my family I have an elder sibling who's a 
                singer. My dad is a pharmasist and mom is house wife.
                About me I want to become a professional coder and 
                graphics designer. By passion I'd love be a cosmologist.
                I even do research sometimes about <em>Space science</em>.
